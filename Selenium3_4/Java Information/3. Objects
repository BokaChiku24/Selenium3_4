1) What are objects? 

-> Objects are nothing but the instance of the class
-> A single class can create any number of unique objects.

2) Objects lives in java heap memory. 

-> Java heap is nothing but the memory space taken by the JVM from operating system. 
-> All objects are created in this heap(space). Whenever JVM encounters 'new' keyword, it creates an object in heap. 
-> When there is no space in heap to create objects, then JVM throws 'Out of Memory' error.

3) Creating First Object 

-> public class Student
  {
  public static void main(String[] args)
  {
  Student obj = new Student();
  }
  }
