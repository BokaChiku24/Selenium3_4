Instance Variables Vs Local Variables

1) Instance Variable: 
-> Instance variable are those variables which are declared within a class. 
-> These are known as 'instance variable' because each instance of the class (object) have it's own copy of instance variable.
-> e.g. 
public class Test
{
  
  int i = 10; // instance variable -- Global Variable

}

2) Local Variable:
-> Local variable are those variables which are declared within method.
-> These are know as 'Local Variable' because they formed within method and dies at the end of the method.
-> e.g. 
public class Test
{
  
  public void go()
	{

     int j = 123; // Local variable -- declared inside method body
     
	}

}

3) Class Variables / Static Variables: 
-> To create an class variable we need to use the static keyword. 
-> e.g. 
public class Test
{
  
  static int i = 10; // Class Variable or Static Variable

}

4) Accessing Object's methods and instance variables
-> The methods and instance variables of any object can be accessed by the help of dot operator (.) on reference variable. 
-> referenceVariable.instancevariable/method
-> e.g. 
   For class Animal having eat() method:
   Animal a  = new Animal();
   a.eat();
