Assigning Objects to Reference Variable

1) Before creating a reference variable we have to specify 'object of which class' it is going to refer. 
2) In other word we need to specify the 'class type' of the reference variable. 

public class Test
{
public static void main(String[] args)
{
Test t = new Test();
//Here t is the reference variable which stores the address of the test object in the heap
}
}
