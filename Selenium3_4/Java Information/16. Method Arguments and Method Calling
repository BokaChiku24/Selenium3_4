A) Method Arguments and method Calling

1) Arguments are the values which are passed during calling of a method. These arguments are stored in the parameters of the method. 
2) Number of arguments must be equal to the number of parameters. 
3) Calling a non argument method: 
e.g. a.eat();
4) Calling a single argument method:
e.g. a.eat(45);
5) Calling a multiple argument method:
e.g. a.eat(343, 43, 'C', "Kunal");


B) Predefined Methods: 

1) Predefined methods are those methods which are already defined in java and ready to use. 
2) We can call these methods and ca use in our code directly.
3) e.g. 
Math.random()
-> Math.random() is a method defined in Math class which is used to generate a random number between 0.0 to .9 in double type. 
-> Calling Math.random():
  int x = (int) (Math.random() * 4);
  
  // It will generate the number from 0 to 3
