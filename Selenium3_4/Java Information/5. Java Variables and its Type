Java Variable and its Type

1) Variable are named space of memory which stores the data. 

2) There are two types of variables: 

   A) Primitive Variables: Primitive data types are defined by the programming language. 
                           a) Integer type
                           b) Floating Type
                           c) Character Type
                           d) Boolean 
                           
                           -> Suffix 'l or L' must be used to indicate long otherwise compiler treat it as integer
                           -> Suffix 'f or F' must be used to indicate float otherwise compiler treat is as double
                           -> Suffix 'd or D' must be used to indicate double 
                           
   B) Reference variables//Non-primitive Variables: Reference variables are those variables which stores only address of an 'Object'. Reference variables//Non-primitive Variables defined by the programmer.
