Arrays

-> Arrays are the collection of similar data types.
-> Each variable in an array is known as array element
-> Each variable of array is referenced by a particular integer number which is known as 'array index'
-> The total number variables in array decide the length of the array. 
-> Array index start from 0

Declaration and Initialization of Array
-> In Java array is an object, therefore it is declared and initialize like a object. 
-> Declaration of array variable: int[] array;
-> Constructing the array: 
   new int[(length of the array)];
-> Initialization of Array:
   array[0] = 34;
-> Declaration and initialization in single line: 
   int[] array = { 34, 56, 7, 23, 34};
   
Initialization of array using loop:
-> Arrays can be initialized by using loops
-> int[] array = new int[34];
-> for (int i = 0; i < array.length; i++)
   {
   array[i] = i;
   System.out.println(array[i]);
   }
   
Multi dimensional Arrays
-> Multi-dimenstional arrays are nothing but the 'arrays of arrays' where each element represents a single dimensional array.
