Java String and String Concatenation

1) In Java, 'String' is a class and not a data type and it can be instantiated like other classes. 
-> String s = new String();

2) String Concatenation is basically a way to combine two or more strings into a single string. This is done by '+' operator. 
-> String str = "We" + "are" + "learning" + "Java" + "."

3) String values can be concatenate with any other data type.
-> boolean flag = true;
String str = "This is: " + " " + flag
