               e.g. class Demo()  
                   {
                   
                   
                   }
                   
B) Member Level:
 
   1) public: If a member is marked as public then it is accessible in whole java world.
   
   2) default: If a member have no modifier, then it will be marked as 'default' implicitly and accessible only within its package.
   
   3) protected: If a member is marked as protected then it is accessible in it's package. It is also accessible outside the package but only
