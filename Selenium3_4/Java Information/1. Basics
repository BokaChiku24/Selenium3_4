1) Java is basically a HIGH LEVEL, platform independent, programming language, which works on principles of 
   OBJECT ORIENTATION.
   
2) Java is platform independent. 

-> Class file of java can run on any operating system (e.g. Windows, Linux, Mac etc)
-> It works on 'Write once Run anywhere principle'

3) How java Code Works?

-> Java programming divides into three parts 
   a) Java Compiler
   b) Java Interpreter
   c) JVM
   
-> If there is no syntax error in the code then compiler allows to pass the code and change it to the 'Byte Code' i.e. 
   .class file. e.g. Hello.java -> Hello.class
-> 'Byte Code' understand by machine only
-> Java interpreter executes byte code line by line and gives instructions to the JVM. 
-> JVM read the 'Byte Code' and pass instructions to our 'environment' in a language which is understandable by the 
   environment. 
-> Note: Java interpreter is a part of the JVM

4) Java Configuration 

-> JAVA_HOME - Use this to setup JDK environment in the machine (Variable Name) - (Variable Path)
-> %JAVA_HOME%/bin - Use this in system path to recognize the Java (Variable Name) - (Variable Path)
